        <h1> <b>Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts highest profit in 6 years on AI boom </b> </h1> 

        <img src="./Images/skhynix.avif"> <br> <br> <br>

            <p> SEOUL, July 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix (000660.KS), opens new tab posted its highest quarterly profit since 2018 on Thursday as the Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab supplier said second-half AI chip demand will rise further, such as for high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in generative AI chipsets. It was SK Hynix's third consecutive quarterly profit after losses last year. The world's second-largest memory chipmaker has benefited the most among its peers from AI-driven appetite for high-end chips and enterprise solid-state drives (eSSDs) following its early entry and large investments in the segments. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-supplier-sk-hynixs-q2-profit-soars-ai-boom-2024-07-24/" target="_blank"> <b> Read More....>>> </b> </a>

        <p> The history of the word "computer" is fascinating. It was originally applied to someone who used to compute, or perform computations, in the sixteenth century. Up to the 20th century, the word was used in the same sense as a noun. To perform all types of computations and calculations, women were employed as human computers. 
            By the latter half of the 1800s, the term was also applied to devices that performed calculations. These days, the term is typically used to refer to electrically powered, programmable digital gadgets. </p>

            <br> <br>

        <center><img src="./Images/ENIAC.jpg" width="920" height="600"> </center><br> <br> <br>

        <p>The naive understanding of computation had to be overcome before the true power of computing could be realized. The inventors who worked tirelessly to bring the computer into the world had to realize that what they were creating was more than just a number cruncher or a calculator. They had to address all of the difficulties associated with inventing such a machine, implementing the design, and actually building the thing. The history of the computer is the history of these difficulties being solved. <br>

            <h2> <b>19th Century </h2> </b><br>

            1945 – University of Pennsylvania academics John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert create an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). It was Turing-complete and capable of solving “a vast class of numerical problems” by reprogramming, earning it the title of “Grandfather of computers.” <br>
            
            1946 – The UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer designed in the United States for corporate applications. <br>
